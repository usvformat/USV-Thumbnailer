How do a Linux file thumbnailer work, such as the one that puts icon thumbnails on .exe files?

Could a bash script read a tar.gz file ending in .usv and show its containing thumbnail.svg as the .usv (tar.gz) file thumbnail?
If true, please write an example.

Should be compatible with most DEs like Gnome and Cinnamon, and explorers such as Nemo and Nautilus.








A Linux file thumbnailer works by generating and caching thumbnail images for different file types. When you open a directory in a file manager, the thumbnailer checks the file type and generates a thumbnail image if it's supported. The thumbnail image is then displayed as an icon for that file.

Regarding your question about a bash script reading a tar.gz file ending in .usv and showing its containing thumbnail.svg as the .usv file thumbnail, it is possible to achieve this. However, it requires some additional steps beyond a simple bash script.

Here's an example of how you can accomplish this using a bash script and the tar command:

#!/bin/bash

# Extract the .usv file from the tar.gz archive
tar -xzf archive.tar.gz file.usv

# Rename the extracted .usv file to thumbnail.svg
mv file.usv thumbnail.svg

# Display the thumbnail.svg file using an image viewer
xdg-open thumbnail.svg

In this example, the script extracts the .usv file from the tar.gz archive, renames it to thumbnail.svg, and then opens it using the default image viewer specified by xdg-open. You can customize the script further based on your specific requirements.

Please note that the compatibility with different desktop environments (DEs) and file managers may vary. It's recommended to test the script on the target DEs and file managers to ensure compatibility.
